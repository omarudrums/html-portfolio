<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>An awesome story about overcoming obstacles and getting revenge. RIP Maximus.</p>
<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>One of the funniest cop duos to exist. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are hilarious!</p>
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>What can I say I love comedic duos. Also is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.</p>
