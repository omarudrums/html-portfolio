<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in El Paso, TX on Sept 4th, 1988 and lived in Chaparral, New Mexico for most of my life.</p>

<p>I started drumming at around 8 years old at my dad's church. I was self-taught throught my
  elementary, middle, and high school years. I was involed in marching band, jazz band, concert
  band, and percussion ensemble all four years until I attended New Mexico State University. 
  At NMSU I studied classical percussion performance under the instruction of Dr. Fred Bugbee and Dr Ed Pias. 
  Realizing I wanted to persue a career in modern commercial music I dropped out and studied 
  with a well known drummer and music producer from Mexico named Alvaro Lopez. I wanted to keep persuing 
  a college degree after that so I transferred to the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. There I studied
  with a another well known drummer by the name of Bernie Dresel whose drumming you may have heard
  from the TV show "Family Guy".</p>

<p>Now I live in Nashville, Tennessee and perform with different country, rock, and pop artists, most notably
  with Frank Ray whom I've been associated with since 2017.</p>

<p>Aside from drumming coding has been an interest of mine for some years now. Finally in 2024 I began to 
  take formal lessons and have been continuing to learn it's many aspects ever since.</p>
